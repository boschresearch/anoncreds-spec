## Abstract

The AnonCreds specification is based on the open source verifiable credential
implementation of AnonCreds that has been in use since 2017 as part of the
[Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) open
source project. The extensive use of AnonCreds around the world has made it a de
facto standard for ZKP-based verifiable credentials, and this specification is the
formalization of that implementation.
